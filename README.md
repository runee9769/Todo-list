# Todo-list
In script.js file, I added task.trim() to remove any leading and trailing spaces from the task input. Then, I check if the trimmed task is not an empty string before creating and appending the new task element to the list. If the input is blank, the code will not create a new task element, effectively preventing blank items from being added to the list.
